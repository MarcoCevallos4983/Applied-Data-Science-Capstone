# Applied-Data-Science-Capstone
This is the final capstone project of the IBM Data Science professional certificate by coursera. In this capstone I developed a research of the Falcon 9 rocket launches by Space X in order to
predict if the rocket lauch will be sucessful and if we could reuse the fisrt stage of a lauch.
I perfom data collection using REST API and Web scapring, Data Wrangling, visualization techniques to find insights in the data, buildin a Web app using Dash to present the data in an 
interactive way and finally a mahcine learning model to answer the questions that was made in the bussiness understanding stage.
In this repository you will fin all the notebooks related to this research.
